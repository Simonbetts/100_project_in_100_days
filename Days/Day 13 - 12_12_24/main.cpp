 Day 13 - Stock Management System

The Stock Management System in C++ is a program designed to help businesses manage their stock levels.
It tracks the current inventory of products and allows users to add, delete and modify items in the inventory.
Technologies used in this project include C++ and SQLite. SQLite is used to store and manage data.
C++ is used for the programâ€™s backend, allowing for the stock management system to be easily modified and extended.
The Stock Management System is a powerful tool that can help store owners and managers keep track of their stock,
allowing them to make the most of their resources.

Possible Solutions: C++ programming language, Object-oriented Programming (OOP),
Relational Database Management System(RDBMS), Structured Query Language(SQL) and Multi-threading.
